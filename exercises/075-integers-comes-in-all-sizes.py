# Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. There is no limit in size as there is: 2^31 - 1 (c++ int) or 2^63 -1 (C++ long long int).

# As we know, the result of a^b grows really fast with increasing b.

# Let's do some calculations on very large integers.

# Task

# Read four numbers, a, b, c, and d, and print the result of a^b + c^d.

# Input Format

# Integers a, b, c, and d are given on four separate lines, respectively.

# Constraints
# 1 <= a <= 1000
# 1 <= b <= 1000
# 1 <= c <= 1000
# 1 <= d <= 1000

# Output Format

# Print the result of  on one line.

# Sample Input
mline = """
# 9
# 29
# 7
# 27
# Sample Output
# 4710194409608608369201743232  
"""
print(mline)

# Note: This result is bigger than 2^63 - 1. Hence, it won't fit in the long long int of C++ or a 64-bit integer.
import math

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
d = int(input())

result = pow(a,b) + pow(c,d)
