ðŸ“Œ Why is 142 bytes using 8 blocks?
Filesystem Blocks Are Fixed Size

Most Linux filesystems (like ext4) allocate blocks in fixed sizes, often 4 KB (4096 bytes).
Even if a file is smaller than a block, it still takes up a full block.
If the file grows beyond a single block, more blocks are allocated.
Each Block is 512 Bytes in st_blocks

The st_blocks field counts 512-byte blocks (not 4 KB!).
st_blocks = 8 means 8 Ã— 512 = 4096 bytes allocated, which equals one 4 KB block.
File Metadata and Fragmentation Overhead

Small files still consume full blocks due to how storage works.
If a file is heavily fragmented, it may use more blocks than necessary.
ðŸ”¹ Example Calculation
Size of file: 142 bytes
Block size (st_blksize): 4096 bytes
Blocks allocated (st_blocks): 8 Ã— 512 = 4096 bytes
Why 8 blocks? Because st_blocks reports in 512-byte units, and one 4 KB block = 8 Ã— 512.
